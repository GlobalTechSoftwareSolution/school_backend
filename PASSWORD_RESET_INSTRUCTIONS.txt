Password Reset API Implementation
=================================

This implementation adds password reset functionality to the school backend system.

API Endpoints:
--------------

1. Request Password Reset
   - URL: POST /api/password-reset/
   - Description: Sends a password reset email to the user
   - Request Body:
     {
       "email": "user@example.com"
     }
   - Response:
     {
       "message": "Password reset email sent successfully. Please check your inbox."
     }

2. Confirm Password Reset
   - URL: POST /api/password-reset-confirm/<uidb64>/<token>/
   - Description: Allows user to set a new password using the reset link
   - Request Body:
     {
       "new_password": "newpassword123",
       "new_password2": "newpassword123"
     }
   - Response (Success):
     {
       "message": "Password reset successful. You can now login with your new password."
     }
   - Response (Error):
     {
       "error": "Invalid or expired reset link"
     }

How It Works:
-------------

1. User requests password reset by providing their email address
2. System generates a secure token and sends an email with a reset link
3. User clicks the link and is directed to a page where they can enter a new password
4. System validates the token and updates the user's password

Email Configuration:
--------------------

The system uses the email settings configured in settings.py:
- EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
- EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.hostinger.com'
- EMAIL_PORT = 587
- EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
- EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'your-email@yourdomain.com'
- EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'your-email-password'
- DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = 'your-email@yourdomain.com'

Security Features:
------------------

1. Tokens are time-limited (default 24 hours)
2. Tokens are single-use
3. Tokens are cryptographically secure
4. User enumeration is prevented (same response whether email exists or not)
5. Password validation ensures strong passwords

Frontend Integration:
---------------------

To integrate with a frontend application:

1. Create a "Forgot Password" form that collects the user's email
2. On form submission, call the password-reset endpoint
3. Create a password reset form that appears when the user clicks the reset link
4. On form submission, call the password-reset-confirm endpoint with the token and new password

Example Usage:
--------------

1. Request password reset:
   POST /api/password-reset/
   {
     "email": "student1@school.com"
   }

2. Receive email with reset link:
   http://example.com/api/password-reset-confirm/MQ/5g-2345678901234567890/

3. Use the reset link to set a new password:
   POST /api/password-reset-confirm/MQ/5g-2345678901234567890/
   {
     "new_password": "newSecurePassword123!",
     "new_password2": "newSecurePassword123!"
   }
